# fcc-product-landing-page
fcc- project for responsive web design cert. 

This one was a true labor <!-- of love -->. 
This was my first foray into making something resposive-ish, and also using flexbox.
Overall I learned a great deal making this product landing page. What I learned the most was that there is soooooooo much left to learn.
There are so many fun nuances in css, and the littlest things can make such a difference. 
A truely fun expereince and I cannot wait to build more.
